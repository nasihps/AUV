# Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Dashboard


## Project Overview
The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a submersible robot designed to explore oceans, lakes, and other aquatic environments. AUVs are deployed for underwater research, ocean hazard analysis, and locating missing persons or property in water bodies.

This project focuses on developing and deploying cost-effective, high-performance algorithms and methodologies for an AUV equipped with advanced machine learning (ML) and computer vision algorithms. These algorithms analyze underwater video footage, detecting and identifying underwater objects, contributing to underwater exploration, inspection, and anomaly detection.
## Objectives
- To advance underwater research technologies.\
- To improve the operational capabilities of the AUV.\
- To develop algorithms for underwater exploration, inspection, and anomaly detection.
## Dashboard Overview
The repository hosts a web-based dashboard for the AUV project. The dashboard provides:

- Details about the AUV project.\
- Live footage object detection and classification.\
- Object detection and classification of recorded footage.
